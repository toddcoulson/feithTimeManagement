Feith Time Management
=========

A project created to let employees at Feith enter time against projects to then allow project managers the ability to track total time of projects and budget accordingly. 

## Installation
  
  This project in its current form is only for viewing code. The database was setup at Feith using their tools, so the sql files have references to bind variables - those are variables used for binding values input into their tool.  

## Usage

  This project shows the ability to connect services, directives to the front end and back end of a project and enable the sql to grab small bits of data as needed in the project.
